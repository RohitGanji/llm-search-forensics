# LLM Search Forensics

A framework for evaluating enterprise LLM search systems, detecting retrieval regressions,
and diagnosing agent failures across retrieval, grounding, and latency.

## Scope

- Retrieval evaluation (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K)
- Golden datasets at passage level
- Failure taxonomy and root-cause diagnosis
- Latency profiling for agent pipelines

## Status

Initial scaffolding. Ingestion and retrieval indexing in progress.
